The academy side, who are still unbeaten so far, looked formidable once again at the Alfredo Di Stéfano. They ran out convincing winners with a disciplined and yet exciting performance on match day four. A Cristo double and another goal for Vnicius Jr. sealed victory for the madridistas.

                            Santiago Solari's men used the space superbly throughout against what was daring opposition. The direct nature of the Whites' play caused real problems, creating chances galore, and the attack-minded approach didn't take long to reap its reward: with just 7 minutes on the clock, López linked up with Cristo in the area and the Canary Islands-born ace wriggled away from two defenders and shot past Carlos Molina.

Since beating Werder Bremen 2-1 back in 2007/08, the Whites have gone on to win every one of their inaugural ties in the competition; eight at the Bernabéu and three away from home. Last season saw them beat APOEL 3-0.

                            Benzema is the team's leading scorer with five. He netted the first of the season in the European Super Cup, and has enjoyed a stellar start to LaLiga, where he has smashed two braces (against Girona and Leganés). Following the Frenchman are Bale and Ramos, each with three. Carvajal, completes the list, having scored the first madridista goal in this LaLiga campaign against Getafe.</td>
